# EnVRT Presentation AP Research
 EnVRT is a VR app I made for environmental therapy for my AP Research class. This repo holds the code I used to make it using Motion Canvas. 

cd in to presentation and run `npm start`. Open the link after it loads, and on the left change the "Render" option to "Present". Then you can view the presentation (albeit without audio). 

This was made for my Environmental Therapy VR App research paper, for which the source code is found below:
